# Horiseon-seo Challenge 

## Description 
My motivation for this task was to put into practice what I've learned in the past week for HTML & CSS Selector. I did this refactoring of the existing code in order to share a cleaner version of the html document without affecting the website layout. I learned to replace what it is truly necessarie from the CSS Selectors and HTML elements without impacting the website layout and the user experience. 

## Credits
This task was in collaboration with Columbia Univerisity BootCamp Experience.
